## A. Lack of Two-Step Ownership Transfer Mechanism
[PanopticFactory.sol#L147-L155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-panoptic/blob/833312ebd600665b577fbd9c03ffa0daf250ed24/contracts/PanopticFactory.sol#L147-L155)
The contract lacks a two-step ownership transfer mechanism. Currently, ownership transfer is performed in a single step through the `transferOwnership` function. This function allows the current owner to transfer ownership directly to a new owner without any intermediary steps.
```solidity
/// @notice Set the owner of the Panoptic Factory.
/// @param newOwner The new owner of the Panoptic Factory
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external {
    address currentOwner = s_owner;

    if (msg.sender != currentOwner) revert Errors.NotOwner();

    s_owner = newOwner;

    emit OwnershipTransferred(currentOwner, newOwner);
}
```
### Impact:
The absence of a two-step ownership transfer mechanism can introduce security risks, especially in scenarios where multiple parties are involved in ownership transitions. Without an intermediary step, there is a lack of validation or verification before the final ownership transfer occurs. This could potentially lead to unauthorized or unintended ownership changes, compromising the integrity and security of the contract.

### Mitigation:
Implement a two-step ownership transfer mechanism to enhance security and mitigate risks associated with direct ownership transfers.
