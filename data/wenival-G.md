The PanopticFactory contract is responsible for creating and registering Panoptic Pools. It uses the Uniswap V3 factory contract to deploy a new Panoptic Pool and initializes it with a full-tick-range liquidity deployment. A Uniswap V3 pool is uniquely identified by its tokens and the fee, and each Uniswap V3 pool can only be linked to one Panoptic Pool.

This contract includes features such as:

1. `deployNewPool`: This function allows the owner of the contract to create a new Panoptic Pool and link it to a Uniswap V3 pool. The function also sets the initial observation cardinality of the Uniswap pool, which is the number of past observations of the pool's state that are stored. 

2. `minePoolAddress`: It allows finding the salt which would give a Panoptic Pool the highest rarity within the search parameters. The rarity is defined in terms of how many leading zeros the Panoptic pool address has.

3. `getPanopticPool`: It allows querying the address of the Panoptic Pool associated with a specific Uniswap V3 pool.

4. `uniswapV3MintCallback`: It is a callback function that is called after minting liquidity to a position.

5. `transferOwnership`: It allows the current owner of the contract to transfer the ownership to another account.

6. `initialize`: This function is used to set the initial state of the contract.

The contract also emits events to track actions like the transfer of ownership and the deployment of a new pool.
