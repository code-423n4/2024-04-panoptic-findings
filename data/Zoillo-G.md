This Solidity code defines a custom data structure called `LiquidityChunk` that is used to represent a portion of liquidity within a specific range of ticks in a concentrated liquidity automated market maker (AMM). These are commonly employed in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Uniswap V3, where users can supply liquidity in specified price ranges, rather than across the entire price curve.

Here's a brief explanation of the various components of the code:

 Import Statement:
- The import statement at the beginning of the code includes a custom type `TokenId` from another module to be used in conjunction with `LiquidityChunk`.

 Type Declaration: 
- The `LiquidityChunk` is defined as a custom type alias for `uint256`, meaning that it will be stored as a 256-bit integer.

Library: `LiquidityChunkLibrary`
- It provides functions to work with `LiquidityChunk` and encodes/decodes its parts:
    - `liquidity`: The amount of liquidity in the chunk.
    - `tickLower`: The lower bound of the price range.
    - `tickUpper`: The upper bound of the price range.
Encoding functions:
- `createChunk`: Creates a new `L
