## 1 - Missing Pool Initialization Validation (Potential DoS)

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-panoptic/blob/main/contracts/SemiFungiblePositionManager.sol#L350-L391

The `initializeAMMPool` function contains a while loop that increments `poolId` to find a unique identifier in case of a collision. Without a maximum iteration limit, this could potentially leading to a `denial-of-service` (DoS) condition.

Implementing a maximum iteration limit or another collision resolution mechanism is advisable to mitigate this risk.

The `initializeAMMPool` function in the provided Solidity contract is designed to initialize a `Uniswap v3 pool` within the Semi-Fungible Position Manager (SFPM). During initialization, the function calculates a `poolId` based on the Uniswap v3 pool's address and fee tier. This `poolId` is used as a key to map the Uniswap v3 pool address to its corresponding `SFPM` pool data.

**Here's a step-by-step explanation of the potential issue:**

1 - **Pool ID Calculation:** The `poolId` is derived from the Uniswap v3 pool address and fee tier. It uses the `16-bit` tick spacing and the most significant `48 bits` of the pool address.

2 - **Collision Check:** The contract checks if the calculated `poolId` already exists in `s_poolContext`. If it does, this indicates a collision, meaning another pool has already been initialized with the same `poolId`.

3 - **Resolution:** To resolve the collision, the contract enters a while loop that increments the poolId until a unique identifier is found.

4 - **DoS Risk:** Since there is no upper limit on the number of iterations this while loop can perform, it could run indefinitely if there are many collisions. This could be exploited by an attacker who can craft pool addresses that intentionally cause collisions, leading to a denial-of-service attack by consuming all available gas or causing the transaction to exceed the block gas limit.

###### Mitigation

To mitigate this risk, the contract should implement a maximum iteration limit within the while loop. If the limit is reached, If the limit is reached, the function should revert to prevent an infinite loop. This limit ensures that even if collisions occur, the function will fail safely without causing a denial-of-service condition. Additionally, the contract could implement alternative collision resolution strategies that are less prone to such risks.

**For example:**

- **Maximum Iterations:** Introduce a counter that increments with each loop iteration. If the counter exceeds a predefined threshold, the function reverts.

- **Alternative Collision Handling:** Use a more sophisticated hashing or mapping strategy that minimizes the chance of collisions in the first place.

- **Resource Limiting:** Set a gas limit for operations within the function to ensure it cannot consume an excessive amount of resources.

By implementing these safeguards, the contract can protect against potential `DoS` attacks that exploit the collision resolution process in `initializeAMMPool`.

## 2 - Missing Slippage Protection

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-panoptic/blob/main/contracts/SemiFungiblePositionManager.sol#L756-L852

The `swapInAMM` function does not implement explicit slippage protection via minimum output amounts or price checks. However, it does use extreme values for `sqrtPriceLimitX96` to indicate the direction of the swap. Users must rely on external mechanisms or careful parameter selection to manage slippage. Implementing direct slippage protection could be beneficial.

The `swapInAMM` function in the contract is designed to handle swaps that are necessary when `minting` or `burning` positions that are in-the-money `ITM`. This function determines the direction of the swap and the amount to swap based on the `ITM` amounts of `token0` and `token1`.

**Here's a detailed breakdown of the slippage protection aspect:**

1 - **Swap Direction and Amounts:** The function calculates whether the swap will be from `token0` to token1 or vice versa, and the amount to swap, based on the `ITM` amounts.

2 - **Price Limits:** The function sets extreme values for `sqrtPriceLimitX96` depending on the swap direction. This is a rudimentary form of slippage protection that ensures the swap does not occur at a price worse than the current Uniswap pool price.

3 - **Lack of Direct Slippage Protection:** Despite setting `sqrtPriceLimitX96`, there is no explicit check for minimum output amounts or a specific price range within which the swap must occur. This means that large price movements between the initiation and execution of the swap could lead to unfavorable rates for the user.

4 - **External Management of Slippage:** Users or integrating contracts need to manage slippage externally. This could involve checking conditions before calling the function or using other mechanisms to ensure favorable swap rates.

5 - **Potential Improvements:** To enhance slippage protection, the contract could implement features like checking for a minimum output amount or allowing users to specify a maximum acceptable slippage percentage. This would provide stronger guarantees about the execution price of the swap.

In summary, while the `swapInAMM` function uses extreme `sqrtPriceLimitX96` values to indicate swap direction, it doesn't offer direct slippage protection through minimum output guarantees or specific price bounds. Users must manage slippage risk themselves, possibly by setting parameters carefully or using external tools.

**Potential improvements could include:**

- Minimum Output Amount: Implementing a parameter that specifies the minimum amount of output tokens expected from the swap.

- Price Impact Checks: Adding a check to ensure the price impact of the swap does not exceed a certain threshold.

- Revert on High Slippage: Allowing the transaction to revert if the actual price obtained after the swap is significantly worse than the expected price.

Adding such features would provide users with stronger protections against slippage, ensuring more predictable and secure swap outcomes within the contract.
