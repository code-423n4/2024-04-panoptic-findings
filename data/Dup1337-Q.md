## [L-01] Pool deployer might be suffered due to excess gas consumption on mainnet
When the user deploys a panoptic pool via the factory contract, the requirements are that the uniV3 pool should `exist` and `initialized`:
```solidity
Contract: PanopticFactory.sol

227:         IUniswapV3Pool v3Pool = IUniswapV3Pool(UNIV3_FACTORY.getPool(token0, token1, fee));
228:         if (address(v3Pool) == address(0)) revert Errors.UniswapPoolNotInitialized();
229: 
230:         if (address(s_getPanopticPool[v3Pool]) != address(0))
231:             revert Errors.PoolAlreadyInitialized();
```
And later on the cardinality is increased to 100:
```solidity
Contract: PanopticFactory.sol

259:         v3Pool.increaseObservationCardinalityNext(CARDINALITY_INCREASE); 
```

But this pattern might not be the best for the deployer when the UniV3 pool remained at the cardinality 1, due to UniV3 pools have a default cardinality of 1 at deployment
So the panoptic pool deployer will need to iterate it 99 times to make it 100 if it remained default:

```solidity
Contract: UniswapV3Pool.sol

254:     function increaseObservationCardinalityNext(uint16 observationCardinalityNext)
255:         external
256:         override
257:         lock
258:         noDelegateCall
259:     {
260:         uint16 observationCardinalityNextOld = slot0.observationCardinalityNext; // for the event
261:         uint16 observationCardinalityNextNew = observations.grow(
262:             observationCardinalityNextOld,
263:             observationCardinalityNext
264:         );
265:         slot0.observationCardinalityNext = observationCardinalityNextNew;
266:         if (observationCardinalityNextOld != observationCardinalityNextNew)
267:             emit IncreaseObservationCardinalityNext(observationCardinalityNextOld, observationCardinalityNextNew);
268:     }
269: 
```
and the iteration part :

```solidity
Contract: Oracle.sol

115:     function grow(
116:         Observation[65535] storage self,
117:         uint16 current,
118:         uint16 next
119:     ) internal returns (uint16) {
120:         unchecked {
121:             if (current <= 0) revert I();
122:             // no-op if the passed next value isn't greater than the current next value
123:             if (next <= current) return current;
124:             // store in each slot to prevent fresh SSTOREs in swaps
125:             // this data will not be used because the initialized boolean is still false
126:             for (uint16 i = current; i < next; i++) self[i].blockTimestamp = 1;
127:             return next;
128:         }
129:     }
```
and here´s the uniV3 initialize function returning default `cardinality` and `cardinalitynext` for reference

```solidity
Contract: Oracle.sol

57:     function initialize(Observation[65535] storage self, uint32 time)
58:         internal
59:         returns (uint16 cardinality, uint16 cardinalityNext)
60:     {
61:         self[0] = Observation({
62:             blockTimestamp: time,
63:             tickCumulative: 0,
64:             secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128: 0,
65:             initialized: true
66:         });
67:         return (1, 1); @audit DEFAULT VALUES HERE
68:     }
```

## [L-02] `assertPriceWithinBounds` doesn´t validate the bounds 

The `assertPriceWithinBounds` function is actually made for Multicall.
As per the NATSPEC it´s used for reverting the call if current Uniswap price is not within the provided bounds with the additional notice to dev as :
```solidity
Contract: PanopticPool.sol

334:     /// @dev Can be used for composable slippage checks with `multicall` (such as for a force exercise or liquidation)
335:     /// @dev Can also be used for more granular subtick precision on slippage checks
```
The function is as below:
```solidity
Contract: PanopticPool.sol

338:     function assertPriceWithinBounds(uint160 sqrtLowerBound, uint160 sqrtUpperBound) external view {
339:         (uint160 currentSqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = s_univ3pool.slot0();
340: 
341:         if (currentSqrtPriceX96 <= sqrtLowerBound || currentSqrtPriceX96 >= sqrtUpperBound) { 
342:             revert Errors.PriceBoundFail();
343:         }
344:     }
```

However, it reverts even when the bounds are equal to current price.
This can endanger a liquidation or a forceExercise call when the current tick actually corresponds to the `SqrtTickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(sqrtPriceX96)` which means that it can´t be exercisable while it can.
We believe a further validation of current tick corresponding the price should be carried out and the function could be reverted accordingly.

## [L-03] No possibility to liquidate big positions of esoteric tokens
Liquidations currently work in a fashion, that `liquidator` has to provide the missing liquidity for the user in order for the `liquidatee` to have enough balance to close off liquidated positions. Then, the positions are closed off and liquidator received back what they provided + liquidation incentive. 

However, in case of markets with smaller liquidity, it may pose risk, that the liquidator is not able to get enough funds, even via flashloans, to cover liquidatable position losses upfront before receiving the capital back after the liquidations. In such cases, some big positions could not be liquidated, leading to huge losses for PLPs (Panoptic Liquidity Providers)

We believe that, the positions could be limited not to be holding a greater value of the limit same like `maxBalance`.

## [L-04] Validated bounds are not exlusive at `_validateAndForwardToAMM` 
`_validateAndForwardToAMM` function checks the proposed option position and size and forwards the minting and potential swapping tasks.
Accordingly it takes inputs of `tickLimitLow` for lower limits on potential slippage, `tickLimitHigh` for upper limits on potential slippage.

```solidity
Contract: SemiFungiblePositionManager.sol

680:     function _validateAndForwardToAMM(
681:         TokenId tokenId,
682:         uint128 positionSize,
683:         int24 tickLimitLow,
684:         int24 tickLimitHigh,
685:         bool isBurn
686:     ) internal returns (LeftRightUnsigned[4] memory collectedByLeg, LeftRightSigned totalMoved) {
687:         // Reverts if positionSize is 0 and user did not own the position before minting/burning
688:         if (positionSize == 0) revert Errors.OptionsBalanceZero();
689: 
690:         /// @dev the flipToBurnToken() function flips the isLong bits
691:         if (isBurn) {
692:             tokenId = tokenId.flipToBurnToken();
693:         }
694: 
695:         // Validate tokenId
696:         tokenId.validate(); 
697: 
698:         // Extract univ3pool from the poolId map to Uniswap Pool
699:         IUniswapV3Pool univ3pool = s_poolContext[tokenId.poolId()].pool;
700: 
701:         // Revert if the pool not been previously initialized
702:         if (univ3pool == IUniswapV3Pool(address(0))) revert Errors.UniswapPoolNotInitialized();
703: 
704:         // initialize some variables returned by the _createPositionInAMM function
705:         LeftRightSigned itmAmounts;
706: 
707:         // calls a function that loops through each leg of tokenId and mints/burns liquidity in Uni v3 pool
708:         (totalMoved, collectedByLeg, itmAmounts) = _createPositionInAMM(
709:             univ3pool,
710:             tokenId,
711:             positionSize,
712:             isBurn
713:         );
714: 
715:         if (tickLimitLow > tickLimitHigh) {
716:             // if the in-the-money amount is not zero (i.e. positions were minted ITM) and the user did provide tick limits LOW > HIGH, then swap necessary amounts
717:             if ((LeftRightSigned.unwrap(itmAmounts) != 0)) {
718:                 totalMoved = swapInAMM(univ3pool, itmAmounts).add(totalMoved);
719:             }
720: 
721:             (tickLimitLow, tickLimitHigh) = (tickLimitHigh, tickLimitLow);
722:         }
723: 
724:         // Get the current tick of the Uniswap pool, check slippage
725:         (, int24 currentTick, , , , , ) = univ3pool.slot0();
726: 
727:         if ((currentTick >= tickLimitHigh) || (currentTick <= tickLimitLow)) 
728:             revert Errors.PriceBoundFail();
729:     }
```

Line 727: checks whether the current tick touches `tickLimitLow` or `tickLimitHigh` to revert.
However, this might not be a good implementation especially when the positions can actually be minted or burnt on the input prices.
We recommend the implementation below:
```diff
- if ((currentTick >= tickLimitHigh) || (currentTick <= tickLimitLow)) 
+ if ((currentTick > tickLimitHigh) || (currentTick < tickLimitLow)) 
```

## [L-05] `deployNewPool` function can suffer users in re-orgs at some conditions
The CollateralTracker deployment is based on `create` rather than `create2` as in PanoptiFactory deployment:
```solidity
Contract: PanopticFactory.sol

240:         // Deploy collateral token proxies
241:         CollateralTracker collateralTracker0 = CollateralTracker( 
242:             Clones.clone(COLLATERAL_REFERENCE)
243:         );
244:         CollateralTracker collateralTracker1 = CollateralTracker(
245:             Clones.clone(COLLATERAL_REFERENCE)
246:         );
247: 
```

So if Alice transacts her TX for `ColleteralTracker.deposit()` and if the chain is re-orged before her transfer, due to lagged confirmation, her funds will get lost irrecoverably.
While the pool address can be derived again, the collateralTracker address can not. 


We recommend exercising `COLLATERAL_REFERENCE.cloneDeterministic(salt)` for the collateral tracker deployment too rather than cloning the reference.

## [L-06] Liquidations for depegged tokens don´t provide proper incentive
If a position is subject to be liquatted due to being undercollateralized, because of a depeg/black swan event, liquidating those and haircutting the deppegged token to the liquidator is not the right incentive due to a collapsing fund can´t be assumed as reward but a bad gift.


```solidity
Contract: PanopticPool.sol

1116:             // if premium is haircut from a token that is not in protocol loss, some of the liquidation bonus will be converted into that token 
1117:             // reusing variables to save stack space; netExchanged = deltaBonus0, premia = deltaBonus1
1118:             address _liquidatee = liquidatee;
1119:             TokenId[] memory _positionIdList = positionIdList;
1120:             int24 _finalTick = finalTick;
1121:             int256 deltaBonus0;
1122:             int256 deltaBonus1;
1123:             (deltaBonus0, deltaBonus1) = PanopticMath.haircutPremia(
```

We recommend considering the haircut to be in stables with a further AMM Swap to challenge this.


## [NC-01] Deposit and mint sizes can be circumvented
Both `deposit` and `mint` functions validate the input amount is not greater than `type(uint104).max`

```solidity
Contract: CollateralTracker.sol

417:     function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) external returns (uint256 shares) {
418:         if (assets > type(uint104).max) revert Errors.DepositTooLarge();
// .....//

477:     function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) external returns (uint256 assets) {
478:         assets = previewMint(shares);
479: 
480:         if (assets > type(uint104).max) revert Errors.DepositTooLarge();
```

However, if the said collaterals are of extremely cheap tokens with large decimals, the total deposit can be bypass the limit by having multiple deposits or mints.
It´s also possible that a third party engaged in Panoptic can do that with a customrouter contract depositing in the name of their users.
