This Solidity code provides a library called `CallbackLib` for verifying and decoding Uniswap version 3 (V3) callbacks. The library checks that the address claiming to be a Uniswap pool is indeed a canonical pool with a specific configuration defined by two tokens and a fee tier. This is crucial for ensuring that callback functions are not exploited by unverified contracts.

Key components of this library include:

1. `PoolFeatures` struct: Holds information about a Uniswap pool's configuration, including the addresses of the two tokens in the pool and the fee tier.

2. `CallbackData` struct: Contains `PoolFeatures` data and the address of the `payer`. This information is passed during Uniswap pool callbacks such as `mint` or `swap`.

3. `validateCallback` function:
   - Parameters: 
     - `sender`: Address initiating the callback, claiming to be a Uniswap pool.
     - `factory`: Address of the Uniswap V3 factory contract.
     - `features`: Claimed features (`token0`, `token1`, `fee`) of the `sender`.
   - Functionality: The function retrieves the pool from the Uniswap factory using `getPool` with the provided token addresses
