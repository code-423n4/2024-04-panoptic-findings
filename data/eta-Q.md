# [L-01]Code and comment mismatch

In CollateralTracker.sol, lines 321 and 338 it says `"the caller must have a balance of at least 'amount'"` and `"the 'from' must have a balance of at least 'amount'"`, but the functions `transfer` and `transferFrom` do not check whether they have enough balance. Consider either removing those comments or putting the code to meet the requirments as shown below:

# [L-02]Refining CollateralTracker for L2's Decentralized Sequencing: Navigating Emerging Challenges in Transaction Fairness
As Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum or Base contemplate a shift toward decentralized sequencer models, they confront the task of maintaining robust measures to mitigate frontrunning risks inherent in traditional "first come, first served" systems.

This transition poses the potential reintroduction of vulnerabilities related to transaction order manipulation, necessitating innovative approaches to uphold transaction fairness. Strategies such as commit-reveal schemes, submarine sends, Fair Sequencing Services (FSS), decentralized MEV mitigation techniques, alongside the integration of time-locks and randomness, emerge as crucial tools. These measures are designed to safeguard the integrity of transaction sequencing, ensuring that the evolution of L2 towards decentralization bolsters its ecosystem while preserving the security and fairness essential for user confidence and platform resilience.
