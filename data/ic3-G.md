Please note that the provided Solidity code is for a library called `InteractionHelper`, which seems to be designed to help with token interactions, particularly in the context of a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol. The code is associated with Axicon Labs Limited and has a BSD 1-Clause License, which is a permissive license allowing for redistribution and use.

Here's a brief breakdown of `InteractionHelper`'s functionality:

1. `doApprovals`: Approves a `SemiFungiblePositionManager` (SFPM) and two `CollateralTracker` contracts to transfer two ERC20 tokens on behalf of another contract (presumably a pool contract). This is a common pattern in DeFi to allow contracts to manage tokens for users.

2. `computeName`: Given two ERC20 tokens and their fees, along with the information about whether it's token0 or token1, this function constructs a name for a CollateralTracker token based on the symbols of the underlying tokens and the fee tier of the pool.

3. `computeSymbol`: Returns a concatenated symbol based on a prefix and the symbol of the underlying ERC20 token.

4. `computeDecimals`: Returns the number of decimals the underlying ERC20 token uses, defaulting to
