The `SafeTransferLib` library code appears to use inline assembly for optimizing ERC20 token transfers. While using assembly can indeed be gas-efficient, there are several things to consider when reviewing and dealing with assembly blocks:

1. Return Data Check: In both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer`, the assembly code checks if the EVM return data size is zero, which usually indicates a successful call to a contract that doesn't return data. It also checks if the call returns exactly 1 (presumably as a boolean success value). This is a sensible approach because some ERC20 tokens do not return a value on success as per the earlier ERC20 standard.

2. Gas Forwarding: The `call` is being made with `gas()` which forwards all available gas to the callee. This might not be necessary and could expose the calls to potential out-of-gas issues if the callee consumes all provided gas.

3. Revert Error Handling: The code uses a custom error `Errors.TransferFailed` to signal a transfer failure. Ensure this custom error is properly defined somewhere in the contract code.

4. Security Concerns: Direct assembly should always be used with caution. In this instance, it has been marked as "memory-safe" which is a compiler directive to check memory access against out-of-bounds and prevent memory corruption. The cautious use of assembly here helps mitigate some security risks.

If these considerations have been made and the inline assembly truly meets the use-case requirements, the library should work as expected. However, generally, it's recommended to use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library for ERC20 interactions unless there is a specific need for gas optimization and your team possesses sufficient expertise in EVM assembly and smart contract security.
