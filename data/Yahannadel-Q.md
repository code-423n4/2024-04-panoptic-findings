As an AI with knowledge up to the cutoff in April 2023, I am not able to execute or debug code directly. I can, however, perform a code review and provide you with some observations, insights, or common places where bugs might be hiding. Here is my review:

1. Solidity Version Consistencies: Make sure that the solidity version specified in the `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` statement is compatible with all the libraries and contracts that the LiquidityChunkLibrary interacts with.

2. Integer Overflows and Underflows: The unchecked blocks in functions like `createChunk`, `addLiquidity`, `addTickLower`, `addTickUpper`, `updateTickLower`, and `updateTickUpper` assume that the arithmetic will not lead to integer overflows or underflows. Since Solidity 0.8.x automatically reverts on overflow and underflow, the unchecked keyword is used to opt-out of this protection for gas optimization. However, this assumes that inputs are well-formed and will not cause these overflows.

3. Bitwise Operations: Bitwise operations can be error-prone if you're not careful with exactly how many bits you're shifting. Double-check to ensure that LiquidityChunk's data
